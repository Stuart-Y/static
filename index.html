<h1>Proof of Work</h1>
<p>I didn't feel like making CSS today so my proof of work is complainign about proof of work sytems and cryptocrrency in general</p>

<p>So cryptocurrency has one core problem with it, money does not make money. Investments make money, helpful or addictive products and sysems make money
for money to make money it hass to do som much of a better job at being money that it can push out governments, and governments do not have to follow
anti-monopoly restrictions</p>

<p>Within this already risky system the value of the system becomes intrinsically tied to redundant computing. Now I understand that this stands in for trust. But hwo much cst is to much to try to 
achieve a zero trust monetary system. At its veery core money requires trust that tomrrow there will be something worth speding it on. It 
cannot be entirely separated from the system</p>

<p>Anyway thank youo for coming to my DET rant</p>
